`Gravstrap Theme` is a [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) theme built on top of [Gravstrap Plugin](http://diblas.net/plugins/use-bootstrap-components-as-shortcodes-in-grav-cms), implementing a full web site based on the components provided by that plugin. It is perfect to start a new Bootstrap custom theme or to create your unique design.

The full documentation is available at the [developer's website](http://diblas.net/themes/gravstrap-theme-helps-to-start-a-new-grav-cms-site-with-bootstrap-support).
