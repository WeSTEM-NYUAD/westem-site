# Community Dinners
Our monthly community dinners focus on creating a larger community for weSTEM within NYUAD that includes students, professors, and post-docs. They are a place for people to get to know each other, have meaningful and important conversations while having some good food and a good time! These dinners are sometimes regular dinners where students can cook together and enjoy the night, but could also be focused on other things like creating a study group and course-advising that benefit students within the weSTEM community.
