# High School Conference

The weSTEM High School Conference is a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and locally engaged initiative, designed to promote diversity and female presence in the STEM fields in and beyond the United Arab Emirates by helping high school girls to prepare for successful college studies and a career in STEM.

The 2017 weSTEM High School Conference will focus on developing basic skill sets for girls who aspire to work in STEM. The conference will consist of a series of sessions focusing on career development within the STEM field as well as workshops that teach basic coding and lab-work, and a competition meant to encourage teamwork and collaboration. This yearâ€™s conference serves as a pilot project for an annual conference that aims to advance STEM exposure for high school students.

This will be a unique opportunity for the students to be exposed to the facilities and resources of a world-class research institution.
